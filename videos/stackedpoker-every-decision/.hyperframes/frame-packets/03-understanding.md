## Frame 3 — Understanding

- type: feature_showcase
- status: outline
- duration: 6s
- transition_in: crossfade
- poster: 3s
- scene: Six training surfaces flow through one held window, each handoff a morph rather than a cut
- voiceover: "Understanding is what makes you better."
- blueprint: device-surface-showcase (Adapt)
- persuasion: Breadth, shown without being listed
- focal: the held window itself — the constant through six changes
- roles: assets/svg-8b90c9e1.svg = supporting (grid3x3, range trainer) · assets/svg-773de514.svg = supporting (book-open, lesson) · assets/svg-cd31b306.svg = supporting (trophy, achievement) · assets/svg-6145cd5f.svg = supporting (graduation-cap, modules)
- sfx: one quiet morph swell per handoff, five total, each shorter than the last; no cut sounds, because there are no cuts
- asset_candidates: assets/svg-8b90c9e1.svg — grid3x3; assets/svg-773de514.svg — book-open; assets/svg-cd31b306.svg — trophy; assets/svg-6145cd5f.svg — graduation-cap

Adapt: keep the signature — **one surface held as hero while its screens cycle
through a real flow**, the camera holding rather than travelling. Changed: the cycle
is six surfaces rather than a device carousel, and every handoff is a
`card morph-anchor` (`card-morph-anchor`) so the container's size, radius and
contents transform between states instead of swapping. The brief's words are "de UI
vloeit in elkaar over" — that is a morph, not a cut.

Order is fixed: range trainer → board builder → decision spot → lesson →
achievement → dashboard. Roughly 1s per state, but the **morph is continuous**, so no
state ever fully stops. All six are real StackedPoker surfaces, not abstractions.

Scene 1 (0.0–1.0s): the window resolves out of the previous frame's drawer by
`scale-swap` (`scale-swap-transition`) — the drawer and the window share a centre, so
the crossfade reads as one object becoming another. **Range trainer**: a 13×13 grid
fills by index-driven sweep. VO line 4 lands across this window.

Scene 2 (1.0–2.0s): morph to **board builder** — the container's proportions shift
and a card lands into a flop slot on the settle.

Scene 3 (2.0–3.0s): morph to **decision spot** — pot, seats, three buttons; one is
already committed, so this reads as a memory of Frame 1 rather than a repeat of it.

Scene 4 (3.0–4.0s): morph to **lesson** — a question and its answer rows, mid-flow.

Scene 5 (4.0–5.0s): morph to **achievement** — a badge resolving. Restrained: no
shimmer, no burst. In this film the achievement is evidence, not a reward.

Scene 6 (5.0–6.0s): morph to **dashboard** — the widest of the six, already reading
as the environment Frame 4 will reveal. Settles and holds. This is the handoff
Frame 4 opens from.

# Card Morph Anchor

A free-floating container morphs apparent size, corner radius, and surface treatment between two shots — the morph itself IS the transition; the viewer's eye tracks the persistent container. Distinct from [anchored-layout-expand.md](anchored-layout-expand.md) (an edge-pinned live layout participant that grows along one axis and reflows neighbors — here nothing is pushed) and [theme-crossfade-morph.md](theme-crossfade-morph.md) (a whole-theme reskin under a fixed anchor — here a single container changes shape).

## How It Works

Since `width`/`height` tweens are forbidden, **substitute uniform `scale` for apparent size**; the remaining morph channels are **paint-only**: `borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`. All channels ride ONE tween (one ease, one duration) so the shape morphs in lockstep. Content choreography: old content fades out during the first ~40% of the morph, new content fades in during the last ~40% — the shape-only gap between is the natural "blink." Optionally the morph card itself fades at the very end, revealing the real next-shot element rendered behind it.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<!-- DOM order = stacking: the anchor renders BEFORE the card, so the card is on top -->
<div class="next-shot-anchor"><img src="{nextShotAnchor}" alt="anchor" /></div>
<div class="morph-card">
  <div class="content-old">{shotOneContent}</div>
  <div class="content-new">{shotTwoContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.morph-card {
  width: SHOT_ONE_W;
  height: SHOT_ONE_H; /* shot-1 geometry; the morph is scale, never width/height */
  border-radius: SHOT_ONE_RADIUS;
  background: {surfaceShotOne};
  overflow: hidden; /* content must clip during the shape change */
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  will-change: transform;
}
.content-old,
.content-new {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.content-new {
  opacity: 0; /* author its inner sizes at apparent-size ÷ END_SCALE — it scales with the card */
}
.next-shot-anchor {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 0; /* fades in as the morph card fades out */
}
```

```js
const END_SCALE = SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W; // uniform — keep the two shots aspect-matched

// Hold shot 1 for HOLD_BEAT first — an instant morph reads as glitchy.

// One tween, all channels: uniform scale + paint-only properties.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  {
    scale: END_SCALE,
    borderRadius: SHOT_TWO_RADIUS / END_SCALE, // borderRadius is pre-scale — divide to land the APPARENT radius
    background: "{surfaceShotTwo}",
    boxShadow: "{shadowShotTwo}",
    duration: MORPH_DUR,
    ease: "power2.inOut",
  },
  MORPH_START,
);

tl.to(
  ".content-old",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * OLD_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in" },
  MORPH_START,
);
tl.to(
  ".content-new",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * NEW_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - NEW_FADE_FRAC),
);

// Optional handoff — card fades out over the pixel-identical real anchor.
tl.to(
  ".morph-card",
  { opacity: 0, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.in", immediateRender: false },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
tl.to(
  ".next-shot-anchor",
  { opacity: 1, duration: MORPH_DUR * FINAL_FADE_FRAC, ease: "power1.out" },
  MORPH_START + MORPH_DUR * (1 - FINAL_FADE_FRAC),
);
```

## Morph channels

| channel        | how                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| apparent size  | uniform `scale` — the substitution for the forbidden `width`/`height` tween; aspect preserved  |
| `borderRadius` | paint-only; pre-scale units — tween to `APPARENT_RADIUS / END_SCALE`, ≤ half the smaller side  |
| `background`   | paint-only; gradients interpolate only with equal stop counts (solid→solid: `backgroundColor`) |
| `boxShadow`    | paint-only; base shadow → accent glow shifts emphasis                                          |

## Variations

- **Landing on a non-centered target** (dock icon, sidebar slot): add `x`/`y` to the same tween, computed as the FLIP-style delta between the card's and the target's rects — `getBoundingClientRect()` both at build time (single-scene only, per the contract) and tween the difference. Don't hand-compute from CSS values: paddings, borders, and parent transforms compound, and center-vs-edge arithmetic is the classic off-by-half bug.
- **Aspect change between shots**: uniform scale preserves aspect — morph to the nearest uniform fit and let the crossfade/handoff absorb the small delta, or drop the handoff and hold the card's final state.

## Values

| token             | range                     | notes                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| HOLD_BEAT         | 0.6–1.5s                  | ≥ shot 1's entry settle; the viewer must register shot 1 first                       |
| MORPH_DUR         | 0.6–1.2s                  | < 0.5s can't fit both content fades                                                  |
| END_SCALE         | SHOT_TWO_W / SHOT_ONE_W   | icon-sized handoffs typically land at 80–400px apparent width                        |
| SHOT_TWO_RADIUS   | ≤ min(W, H)/2 apparent    | half the smaller side = perfect circle; beyond is clamped                            |
| OLD/NEW_FADE_FRAC | 0.3–0.5 each, sum ≤ 1     | the gap between is the shape-only "blink"                                            |
| FINAL_FADE_FRAC   | 0 (no handoff) or 0.1–0.2 | only when a pixel-identical anchor exists                                            |
| ease              | `power2.inOut` canonical  | `power3`/`expo.inOut` OK; never `back`/`elastic` — overshoot fights the shape change |

## Critical Constraints

- **❗ Uniform-scale substitution** — never tween `width`/`height`; `scale` + the paint-only channels (`borderRadius`, `background`, `boxShadow`) are the ONLY morph properties.
- **❗ Handoff anchor must be pixel-identical to the card's final state** — same apparent size, radius, background, shadow, inner icon dimensions. Any delta = a visible pop during the crossfade. Can't match exactly? Drop the handoff and hold the morph card.
- **❗ Stacking by DOM order, never a z-index snap mid-fade** — render the anchor before the card; a `tl.set({ zIndex })` during an active opacity tween flips stacking before the fade finishes and flickers.
- **`overflow: hidden`** on the card — content must clip as the radius changes.
- **Hold a beat before morphing**; same ease family for shape and crossfade (mixed eases read unsynchronized).

## Selected motion rule: scale-swap-transition

description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

| SUB_REVEAL_DELAY | 0.2–0.4 s                             | reveals during the morph compete with the swap for attention                                           |

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.
